Do **not** use past papers or tests as a guide for what to study or what will be in the exam. 

Use past papers only AFTER you have done your revision and want
to test yourself. The only purpose of past papers is to test yourself.

So labs must be completed before you are ready.

The sample papers provided are for closed book exams where you handwrite on the exam paper. You will be answering on the question paper itself in the spaces that are provided.

Online Open book exams cover similar material but make direct use of the work that you have done, both assessed and not assessed that you had to submit. It can also include work that you were not asked to submit, and so you would needs all the work with you.

Do test1 and then test2 pdf files ***first***.
Time yourself. Exam has time constraints, so practice with time constraints. 

Past exams/tests had different advice on exam coverage. See the 
spreadsheet for this year to obtain advice on coverage.
